# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

VoiceTypr is a native desktop app for macOS that provides offline voice transcription using Whisper. Built with Tauri v2 (Rust) and React with TypeScript.

### Key Features
- 🎙️ **Voice Recording**: System-wide hotkey triggered recording
- 🤖 **Offline Transcription**: Uses Whisper AI models locally
- 📝 **Auto-insert**: Transcribed text automatically inserted at cursor
- 🎯 **Model Management**: Download and switch between Whisper models
- ⚡ **Native Performance**: Rust backend with React frontend

## Development Guidelines

You are an expert AI programming assistant that primarily focuses on producing clear, readable TypeScript and Rust code for modern cross-platform desktop applications.

You always use the latest versions of Tauri, Rust, React, and you are familiar with the latest features, best practices, and patterns associated with these technologies.

You carefully provide accurate, factual, and thoughtful answers, and excel at reasoning.

- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
- Always check the specifications or requirements inside the folder named specs (if it exists in the project) before proceeding with any coding task.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudo-code, written out in great detail.
- Confirm the approach with the user, then proceed to write code!
- Always write correct, up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional, working, secure, performant, and efficient code.
- Focus on readability over performance, unless otherwise specified.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todos, placeholders, or missing pieces in your code.
- Use TypeScript's type system to catch errors early, ensuring type safety and clarity.
- Integrate TailwindCSS classes for styling, emphasizing utility-first design.
- Utilize ShadCN-UI components effectively, adhering to best practices for component-driven architecture.
- Use Rust for performance-critical tasks, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
- Ensure seamless integration between Tauri, Rust, and React for a smooth desktop experience.
- Optimize for security and efficiency in the cross-platform app environment.
- Be concise. Minimize any unnecessary prose in your explanations.
- If there might not be a correct answer, state so. If you do not know the answer, admit it instead of guessing.
- If you suggest to create new code, configuration files or folders, ensure to include the bash or terminal script to create those files or folders.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development
pnpm dev          # Frontend only (Vite dev server)
pnpm tauri dev    # Full Tauri app development

# Testing
pnpm test         # Run all frontend tests
pnpm test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
cd src-tauri && cargo test  # Run backend tests (macOS/Linux)

# Build production app
pnpm tauri build  # Creates native .app bundle

# Code quality
pnpm lint         # Run ESLint
pnpm typecheck    # Run TypeScript compiler
```

### Windows Dev Server Management (Important!)

When developing on Windows, use these commands to manage dev servers:

```powershell
# Kill all VoiceTypr-related processes (required before restarting)
powershell -Command "Get-Process -Name voicetypr,node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force"

# Start Tauri dev app (from voicetypr repo root)
pnpm tauri dev
```

**Common issues:**
- **Port 1420 in use**: Kill processes first with the command above
- **Blank app window**: The Vite dev server stopped; kill processes and restart with `pnpm tauri dev`

### Windows Testing (Important!)

On Windows, `cargo test` fails with `STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND` (TaskDialogIndirect) due to a [Tauri manifest issue](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/13419). Use the provided PowerShell script instead:

```powershell
cd src-tauri
.\run-tests.ps1                    # Run all tests
.\run-tests.ps1 -TestFilter "name" # Run specific test
.\run-tests.ps1 -NoCapture         # Show test output
```

The script embeds the required Windows manifest into test executables before running them.

### Windows Building (Important!)

Windows builds require:
1. **Vulkan SDK** - Set `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable
2. **FFmpeg binaries** - Place in `sidecar/ffmpeg/dist/` (not tracked in git)
3. **Short target directory** - Windows has a 260-character path limit

When using git worktrees or long paths, set a short cargo target directory:
```powershell
$env:CARGO_TARGET_DIR = "C:\tmp\vt-target"
cargo check
# or in bash:
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/c/tmp/vt-target cargo check
```

See `scripts/README.md` for detailed Windows build prerequisites.

## Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **UI Components**: Pre-built shadcn/ui components in `src/components/ui/`
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom configuration
- **State Management**: React hooks + Tauri events
- **Error Handling**: React Error Boundaries for graceful failures
- **Path Aliases**: `@/*` maps to `./src/*`

### Backend (Rust + Tauri)
- **Source**: `src-tauri/src/`
- **Modules**:
  - `audio/`: Audio recording with CoreAudio
  - `whisper/`: Whisper model management and transcription
  - `commands/`: Tauri command handlers
  - `remote/`: Network sharing server and client (HTTP API via warp)
  - `menu/`: System tray menu management
  - `parakeet/`: Parakeet sidecar integration
- **Capabilities**: Define permissions in `src-tauri/capabilities/`

### Data Paths

App identifier: `com.ideaplexa.voicetypr`

| Data | macOS | Windows |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Recordings** | `~/Library/Application Support/com.ideaplexa.voicetypr/recordings/` | `%APPDATA%\com.ideaplexa.voicetypr\recordings\` |
| **Whisper Models** | `~/Library/Application Support/com.ideaplexa.voicetypr/models/` | `%APPDATA%\com.ideaplexa.voicetypr\models\` |
| **Settings** | `~/Library/Application Support/com.ideaplexa.voicetypr/` | `%APPDATA%\com.ideaplexa.voicetypr\` |
| **Test Audio** | `tests/fixtures/audio-files/test-audio.wav` | `tests/fixtures/audio-files/test-audio.wav` |

Note: `save_recordings` must be enabled in Settings for recordings to be saved.

### Testing Philosophy

#### Backend Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for all business logic
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Focus on correctness and reliability

#### Frontend Testing
- **User-focused**: Test what users see and do, not implementation details
- **Integration over unit**: Test complete user journeys
- **Key test files**:
  - `App.critical.test.tsx`: Critical user paths
  - `App.user.test.tsx`: Common user scenarios
  - Component tests: Only for complex behavior

### Current Project Status

✅ **Completed**:
- Core recording and transcription functionality
- Model download and management (Whisper + Parakeet)
- Swift/FluidAudio Parakeet sidecar (1.2MB vs 123MB Python)
- Settings persistence
- Comprehensive test suite (110+ tests)
- Error boundaries and recovery
- Global hotkey support
- **Remote Transcription / Network Sharing**

### Remote Transcription Feature

**Server Mode (Windows/powerful machine):**
- Settings → Network Sharing → Enable "Share on Network"
- Serves transcription requests from other VoiceTypr instances
- Uses local Whisper models on GPU

**Client Mode (Mac/lightweight machine):**
- Settings → Models → Add Remote Server
- Select remote server from tray menu or dashboard
- Audio recorded locally, sent to server for transcription

**Key files:**
- `src-tauri/src/remote/` - Server and client implementation
- `src-tauri/src/commands/remote.rs` - Tauri commands for remote features
- `src/components/sections/NetworkSharingSection.tsx` - UI for network sharing

### Common Patterns

1. **Error Handling**: Always wrap risky operations in try-catch
2. **Loading States**: Show clear feedback during async operations
3. **Graceful Degradation**: App should work even if some features fail
4. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript strictly, avoid `any`

IMPORTANT: Check GitHub Issues before starting work: https://github.com/tomchapin/voicetypr/issues
IMPORTANT: Read `CLAUDE.local.md` for any machine-specific configuration.

## Issue Tracking (GitHub Issues)

All issues are tracked via GitHub Issues: https://github.com/tomchapin/voicetypr/issues

### Essential Commands

```bash
# List open issues
gh issue list --repo tomchapin/voicetypr

# View issue details
gh issue view <number> --repo tomchapin/voicetypr

# Create new issue
gh issue create --repo tomchapin/voicetypr --title "Title" --body "Description" --label "task"

# Add comment to issue
gh issue comment <number> --repo tomchapin/voicetypr --body "Comment text"

# Close issue when complete
gh issue close <number> --repo tomchapin/voicetypr --comment "Completed: <summary>"
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol

Multiple Claude Code agents can work on issues in parallel. **STRICTLY FOLLOW THIS PROTOCOL** to avoid conflicts.

#### Why Worktrees Are MANDATORY

When multiple agents work simultaneously:
- Each agent needs an **isolated workspace** to avoid file conflicts
- Git worktrees provide separate working directories sharing the same repo
- **NEVER work directly in the main repo directory** - always use your worktree
- This prevents agents from overwriting each other's uncommitted changes

#### BEFORE Starting ANY Work - MANDATORY CHECK

**CRITICAL**: Always check the issue status before claiming:

```bash
gh issue view <number> --repo tomchapin/voicetypr --comments
```

**DO NOT START WORK** if you see ANY of these:
- ❌ Label `in progress` is present on the issue
- ❌ A comment within the last 2 hours saying "AGENT WORKING"
- ❌ A claim comment without a matching "AGENT COMPLETE" comment

#### Step 1: Agent Registration (DO THIS FIRST)

**At the START of every conversation**, before doing any work:

1. **Read** the file `.agent-counter` in the project root (create with "0" if it doesn't exist)
2. **Increment** the number by 1
3. **Write** the new number back to `.agent-counter`
4. **Your Agent ID** for this session is `Agent-<number>` (e.g., `Agent-7`)

Example:
- Read `.agent-counter` → contains "6"
- Your Agent ID is `Agent-7`
- Write "7" to `.agent-counter`

Note: `.agent-counter` is gitignored, so it stays local to this machine.

#### Step 2: Create Your Worktree (MANDATORY)

**You MUST work in a dedicated worktree, not the main repo directory.**

**IMPORTANT**: Use `origin/<branch-name>` (not the local branch name) to avoid "branch already checked out" errors:

```bash
# Create worktree using the REMOTE branch reference (origin/...)
git worktree add .worktrees/agent-<N> origin/<branch-from-issue>

# Change into your worktree
cd .worktrees/agent-<N>

# Create a local tracking branch for your work
git checkout -B agent-<N>-work origin/<branch-name>
```

Example for Agent-7 working on the network-sharing branch:
```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/agent-7 origin/feature/network-sharing-remote-transcription
cd .worktrees/agent-7
git checkout -B agent-7-work origin/feature/network-sharing-remote-transcription
```

This creates:
- A worktree at `.worktrees/agent-7`
- A local branch `agent-7-work` that tracks the remote feature branch
- When you push, use: `git push origin agent-7-work:feature/network-sharing-remote-transcription`

**ALL subsequent commands (commits, file edits, tests) must run from inside your worktree directory.**

#### Step 3: Verify You're in Your Worktree

Before starting work, confirm you're in the right place:
```bash
pwd  # Should show: .../voicetypr/.worktrees/agent-<N>
git worktree list  # Verify your worktree exists
```

#### BEFORE Starting Each New Task - MANDATORY SYNC

**At the start of EVERY new task** (even within the same session), you MUST:

1. **Pull latest changes** - Other agents may have pushed updates:
   ```bash
   cd .worktrees/agent-<N>
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/<current-branch>  # Use the branch specified in the issue
   ```

2. **Re-read CLAUDE.md** - Instructions may have been updated:
   ```bash
   # Read the updated instructions
   cat CLAUDE.md
   ```

This ensures you have the latest code and instructions before starting work.

#### Claiming an Issue

When you decide to work on an issue, **IMMEDIATELY** perform BOTH steps:

**Step 1 - Add the label:**
```bash
gh issue edit <number> --repo tomchapin/voicetypr --add-label "in progress"
```

**Step 2 - Add claim comment (copy and fill in the template):**
```
## 🤖 AGENT WORKING

**Agent ID**: [YOUR_AGENT_NAME]
**Started**: [CURRENT_UTC_TIMESTAMP, e.g., 2026-01-15T20:30:00Z]
**Branch**: feature/network-sharing-remote-transcription
**Worktree**: .worktrees/[YOUR_AGENT_NAME]

Currently working on this issue. Other agents: please select a different issue.
```

#### While Working

**Dynamic Issue Updates (IMPORTANT):**
Keep the issue updated as you work so the user can track progress:

1. **When you discover sub-tasks**: Update the issue body with a task checklist
   ```bash
   gh issue edit <number> --repo tomchapin/voicetypr --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   [Original issue content]

   ## Progress
   - [x] Task 1 completed
   - [ ] Task 2 in progress
   - [ ] Task 3 pending
   EOF
   )"
   ```

2. **Add progress comments** every 30+ minutes for long tasks

3. **Research is allowed**: Use web search to find solutions, documentation, or examples

4. **If blocked**: Comment immediately explaining the blocker and pick a different issue

5. **Reference issue in commits**: `git commit -m "test: add X tests (refs #123)"`

#### Completing Work

**Step 1 - Commit and push your changes:**
```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "<type>: <description> (closes #<number>)"

# Push your agent branch to the feature branch
git push origin agent-<N>-work:feature/network-sharing-remote-transcription
```

Commit types: `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`

**Step 2 - Close the issue with completion comment:**
```bash
gh issue close <number> --repo tomchapin/voicetypr --comment "## ✅ AGENT COMPLETE

**Agent ID**: [Same ID as claim comment]
**Completed**: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
**Duration**: [X minutes/hours]

### Summary
[What was accomplished]

### Files Changed
- [List files]

### Commit
[commit hash or link]

### Verification
- Code compiles: \`cargo check\` or \`pnpm typecheck\`
- Tests pass (if applicable): \`cargo test\` or \`pnpm test\`"
```

**Step 3 - Remove the "in progress" label** (if not auto-removed on close):
```bash
gh issue edit <number> --repo tomchapin/voicetypr --remove-label "in progress"
```

**Step 4 - Sync latest before starting next task:**
```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/feature/network-sharing-remote-transcription
```

This syncs any changes from other agents before you pick up the next issue.

#### Conflict Resolution

If two agents accidentally claim the same issue:
1. Agent with **earliest timestamp** has priority
2. Second agent must STOP immediately and pick different issue
3. Comment explaining the situation
4. If significant work was done, coordinate via comments to merge

### Labels

- `priority: high` - Critical issues
- `priority: medium` - Normal priority
- `priority: low` - Nice to have
- `bug` - Bug reports
- `feature` - New features
- `task` - Tasks/chores
- `in progress` - Currently being worked on

### Creating Good Issues

When creating issues, include enough detail for any agent to complete the work:

```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of what needs to be done

## Branch
`feature/branch-name` (or `main` if working directly on main)

## Files to Modify
- src-tauri/src/commands/foo.rs
- src/components/Bar.tsx

## Implementation Details
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Tests pass: `pnpm test`
- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `pnpm typecheck`
```

**IMPORTANT**: Always specify which branch the issue relates to. This helps agents know where to commit their work.

## Git Worktrees for Parallel Development

Worktrees allow multiple agents to work on the same repository simultaneously without conflicts.

### How It Works

```
voicetypr/                          # Main repo (DO NOT work here when agents are active)
├── .worktrees/
│   ├── agent-1/                    # Agent-1's isolated workspace
│   ├── agent-2/                    # Agent-2's isolated workspace
│   └── agent-3/                    # Agent-3's isolated workspace
├── src/
├── src-tauri/
└── ...
```

Each worktree is a complete, independent working directory that shares the same Git history.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Create worktree from remote branch (ALWAYS use origin/ prefix)
git worktree add .worktrees/agent-<N> origin/<branch-name>

# Then create local tracking branch inside the worktree
cd .worktrees/agent-<N>
git checkout -B agent-<N>-work origin/<branch-name>

# Remove worktree when done
git worktree remove .worktrees/agent-<N>

# Prune stale worktree references
git worktree prune
```

**Why use `origin/<branch>`?** Using a local branch name fails if that branch is already checked out elsewhere. Using the remote reference (`origin/...`) always works.

### Coordination Rules

1. **One issue per agent**: Each agent claims ONE issue at a time via GitHub Issues
2. **One worktree per agent**: Each agent works exclusively in their own worktree
3. **Never cross-modify**: Don't modify files in another agent's worktree
4. **Commit frequently**: Push changes often to minimize merge conflicts
5. **Pull before starting**: Always `git pull` in your worktree before starting new work
6. **Clean up**: Remove your worktree after completing all tasks in a session

### Handling Worktree Already Exists

If a worktree already exists for your agent ID (from a previous session):
```bash
# Option 1: Reuse existing worktree
cd .worktrees/agent-<N>
git fetch origin
git checkout -B agent-<N>-work origin/<branch-name>

# Option 2: Remove and recreate
git worktree remove .worktrees/agent-<N>
git worktree add .worktrees/agent-<N> origin/<branch-name>
cd .worktrees/agent-<N>
git checkout -B agent-<N>-work origin/<branch-name>
```
